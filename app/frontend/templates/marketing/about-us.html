                <li>Easy Invoice Manager became the SaaS that solved our own problem.</li>
                <li>We run an successful accounting services SaaS and it has a internal invoicing module for tracking accounts receivables. </li>
                <li>What was missing and is across the accounting landscape is the back office pre accounting processes and activities.</li>
                <li>Accountants do not and should not do a do back office or clerical activities.</li>
                <li>With Easy Invoice Manager we empower the founder or the office staff with the correct process, correct organization and correct data for accountants to complete the financial months closing. </li>
                <li>And many times the accounting is completed after the monthâ€™s end, yet the founder or office staff requires a daily and weekly management tool for payables.</li>
                <li>Monthly accounting never was good enough to manage payables daily or weekly. </li>
                <li>This is where Easy Invoice Manager shines.</li>
