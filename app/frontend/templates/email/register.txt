Dear {{ user.name }},

Welcome to easyinvoicemanager, your all-in-one solution for managing your accounts payable invoices. We are delighted to have you onboard and are confident that our solution will make your invoice process simple, efficient, and stress-free.

To get started, please follow these steps:

Upload your first invoice in either PDF, JPEG, or JPG format and store it securely in the cloud.
Manage your invoices by categorizing them as GL account, department or expense type.
Use our calendar to keep track of your payments and manage your cashflow.
View all invoices by vendor in the vendor detail page to make communication easier.
Provide your accountant with helpful reports such as the Accounts Payable aging report and paid invoices report, both of which can be downloaded in a CSV format like MS Excel.

If you have any questions, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to our support team at support@myeasyinvoicemanager.freshdesk.com.

Happy organizing!

Best regards,
Jeff and the easyinvoicemanager team.
